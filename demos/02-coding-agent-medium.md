# Demo 2: Using GitHub Copilot Cloud Agent to add a (medium) new feature

> [!NOTE]
> This is a demo so it means that the trainer has to run the demo himself

In this demo, we'll use GitHub Copilot Cloud Agent to add a new feature to allow different types of users: member and administrators. This will demonstrate how Copilot Cloud Agent understands context, suggests solutions, and helps test the changes.

## Prerequisites

- A GitHub account with Copilot enabled and access to Copilot Cloud Agent.

## Environment configuration

- Create a new repository from [ps-copilot-sandbox/copilot-agent-and-mcp](https://github.com/ps-copilot-sandbox/copilot-agent-and-mcp) which is a template repository or reuse the repository created in the previous demo
- Clone the repository on your laptop
- Use the instructions in the [`README.md` file](/README.md) to setup your development environment and to start the application
- Quickly explain and demo the application to the audience
- Open the repository on GitHub.com
  - All the following instructions have to be done on this new repository and on GitHub.com

## Setup Steps

These items are already configured. You have to go through them and explain the content:

- [`copilot-setup-steps.yml`](/.github/workflows/copilot-setup-steps.yml)
- [`.github/copilot-instructions.md`](/.github/copilot-instructions.md)

## Feature Request: Allow different types of users

We'll use this feature request to demonstrate Copilot Cloud Agent's capabilities:

1. Go to your newly created repository on GitHub.com
2. Open Copilot Chat and ask:

```prompt
Create an issue for a feature request to allow different types of users: member and administrators. The user type will have to be displayed close to the user name in the header of the application.
```

3. Assign the issue to Copilot.
4. Show the :eyes: emoji reaction to the issue.
5. Show the PR and the content of the body.
6. Open the Actions tab in the repository and find the workflow that was created.
7. Show the Copilot Cloud Agent timeline.
8. Explain the setup workflow.
9. Explain the custom instructions.
10. It can take some time (~7 minutes) for Copilot Cloud Agent to process the request and create the PR, so be patient. It could be a good time to ask participants if they have any questions.
11. Show the PR and the content of the body.
12. Show the Copilot Cloud Agent timeline.
13. Show the result of the PR.
14. Copilot might not give the correct answer the first time, so you can review the PR, add comments and ask Copilot to make changes. This will demonstrate how Copilot Cloud Agent can iterate on feedback and improve the solution.
